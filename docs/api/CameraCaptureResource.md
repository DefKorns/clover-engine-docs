# CameraCaptureResource

2 methods (instance methods).

| Method | Signature | Families | Binding S / N / J | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `getCameraSource` | `CameraCaptureResource:getCameraSource(0 args)` | N | `- / bd5bc / -` | Returns the camera source. |
| `getPixel` | `CameraCaptureResource:getPixel(2 args)` | N | `- / b37d0 / -` | Returns the pixel. |

## How to read the tables

- **Signature**: `Class:method(...)` is an instance method (colon call); `Class.method(...)` is a static function of a
  global table. Types come from the helper the binding uses to read an argument or push a result: `number`, `integer`,
  `boolean`, `string`, or a resource class. `any` means that helper was not classified. For NES-only methods the
  signature lists only the argument count.
- **Families**: S = SNES (EUR, USA, SHVC), N = NES and HVC, J = Shonen. A dash means the family does not bind the method.
- **Binding**: address of the binding function in the SNES EUR 2.0.14, NES 1.0.7 and Shonen 3.0.1 builds.
- **Summary**: derived from the method name (getters and setters only); "Not described (name only)" means nothing beyond the name is known. A **Note** was verified in the code or in the stock scripts.
- Parameter names are not in the binary: single-argument setters use the name after `set`, the others are `argN`.
